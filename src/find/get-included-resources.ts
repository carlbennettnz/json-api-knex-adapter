/**
 * Loads the resources to be included in the request, based on the included paths.
 *
 * This implementation makes a query for each related resource type to be included, and one
 * subquery for each relationship. The queries produced look something like these:
 *
 *     select *
 *     from "author"
 *     where _id in (
 *       select distinct "author"
 *       from "post"
 *       where "post"."title" = "Post 1")
 *
 *     select * from "tags"
 *     where _id in (
 *       select distinct "post_tag"."tag"
 *       from "post"
 *       left join "post_tag" on "post_tag"."post" = "post"."_id"
 *       where "post"."_id" = 1)
 *
 * The where clauses in the subqueries are always the same as in the primary resource query and
 * should have already been applied to the query passed into this function. The passed query is not
 * mutated.
 *
 * There are a few different ways this could be implemented, including some that may perform better
 * than this implementation.
 *
 * For example, if only a single relationship of a given type is being included, the query could be
 * inverted, giving something more like this:
 *
 *     select distinct on("author"."_id") "author".*
 *     from "post"
 *     right join "author" on "author"."_id" = "post"."author"
 *     where "post"."title" = "Post 1"
 *
 * This trades adds a join, but removes a subquery. Is that better? No idea, but if you're having
 * performance problems, it might be worth trying.
 *
 * @param  {QueryBuilder}        query       Knex query with the where clauses (but not select or
 *                                           order by clauses) for the primary request applied.
 *                                           Will not be mutated by this function.
 * @param  {[String]}            paths       List of relationship key names to apply.
 * @param  {[Model]}             models      All models.
 * @param  {String}              primaryType The type of the primary resources.
 * @return {Promise<Collection>}             The collection of resources to be included.
